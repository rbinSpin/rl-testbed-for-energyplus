   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed="WEST DX COOLING COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling capacity is out of range at 1.603E-005 m3/s/W.
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=JUNEFIRST, at Simulation time=06/01 01:00 - 01:15
   **   ~~~   ** Expected range for VolumeFlowPerRatedTotalCapacity=[2.684E-005--6.713E-005]
   **   ~~~   ** Possible causes include inconsistent air flow rates in system components,
   **   ~~~   ** or variable air volume [VAV] system using incorrect coil type.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "WEST DX COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C. This indicates the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature = -11.70 C.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Occurrence info = JUNEFIRST, 06/01 01:00 - 01:01
   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 15.097 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
   ** Warning ** CoolingTower:VariableSpeed "COOLING TOWER" - Tower approach temperature is outside model boundaries at 0.00.

   **   ~~~   **  ...Approach temperatures outside model boundaries may not adversely affect tower performance.
   **   ~~~   **  ...This is not an unexpected occurrence when simulating actual conditions.
   ** Warning ** CoolingTower:VariableSpeed "COOLING TOWER" - Tower range temperature is outside model boundaries at 1.04.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Valid range = 1.11 to 22.22. Occurrence info = JUNEFIRST, 06/01 02:30 - 02:31
